### What I learned

In this project I was working with sass. It was my first time working with separate sass files. I now uderstand how helpfull and flexible it actually is to group files.

I came up with nice logic for the JS part of this project. I made use of async functions to read the json file.

I used lodash library for ES6 modules to make the class names for each window element with the kebabCase function.

```js
import kebabCase from "./node_modules/lodash-es/kebabCase.js";

const markup = `
      <div class="window -not-user window--${kebabCase(el.title)}">;
```

I also learnt some new techniques with media queries and how to maintain stable layout on both mobile and desktop views.

```css
@media (max-width: 950px) {
  .-big {
    display: none;
  }

  .-small {
    display: block;
  }
}

@media screen and (min-width: 950px) {
  .-big {
    display: block;
  }

  .-small {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue working on the frontendmentor.io website to master my skills. This project I had a lot of spaghetti code but I'm getting a hang of it.
